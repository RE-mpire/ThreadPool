A fast efficient MPMC non-blocking thread pool library using C11 intrinsics.

Internally uses MPMC queue to store jobs

## Basic usage
``` c
#include "thread_pool.h"

pool_t* pool = pool_create(4); // create a thread pool with 4 threads

void my_task(void* arg) {
    // do some work
}

// submit a task to the pool
pool_submit(pool, my_task, NULL);

// destroy the pool and wait for all tasks to finish
pool_destroy(pool); 
```
